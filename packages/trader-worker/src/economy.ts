// AgentEconomy — the fly population as a small autonomous economy settling on x402.
//
// THE IDEA. Every fly is an economic agent with its own USDC micro-wallet. Each tick we read the
// drives its 1,080-neuron connectome produced (arousal / turnBias / cohesion / wingbeat / rest +
// behavioural state) and translate them into an ECONOMIC INTENT: what good it wants, how strongly it
// wants to buy, and which peer it turns toward. Buyer and seller then run a real x402 "exact" flow
// against each other (402 requirements → signed payload → facilitator verify → settle → receipt) and
// the swarm's USDC circulates. No LLM decides anything; the spiking network does. See x402.ts for the
// keyless-but-faithful protocol layer.
//
// NEURAL DRIVE → ECONOMIC ACTION (the mapping is the whole point — every knob is a neuron read-out):
//   state        → WHICH good to buy      (EXPLORE→signal, AGITATE→momentum, AGGREGATE→attestation)
//   arousal      → HOW strongly to buy    (buy probability + price tolerance scale with arousal)
//   wingbeat     → deal frequency spice   (a buzzing fly transacts a touch more often)
//   cohesion     → WHO to turn toward     (cohesive → trade with NEAR neighbours; explorer → reach FAR)
//   turnBias     → WHICH side to reach    (+ → higher ids / right half, − → lower ids / left half)
//   rest         → damp everything        (a resting fly barely participates)
//   temperature  → market-wide demand     (HOT → more deals at higher prices; COLD → thin & cheap)
//
// SAFETY / LIVENESS. In the DEFAULT simulated mode money is conserved between agents and a small
// "protocol treasury" tops up any agent that runs nearly dry, so the piece runs forever without a
// wallet or faucet; deals per tick are capped to bound cron CPU. The economy is a strict READ-OUT of
// the neural layer (one-directional) — it never feeds back into the connectome, so it cannot
// destabilise the winner-take-all dynamics (see the fly-brain WTA latch lesson).
//
// REAL MONEY (opt-in, OFF by default). When facilitatorMode==="onchain" AND a facilitator + addressOf
// are injected (see state.ts / keys.ts), agents become real HD wallets with real addresses, the treasury
// top-up is DISABLED (you cannot mint real USDC), and settlement goes through EIP-3009 on the Arc USDC
// precompile. Onchain adds hard rails the keyless path never needed: a kill switch, a global daily spend
// cap, a per-agent daily cap, plus a facilitator-level per-deal cap and shadow-only mode. EVERY rail is
// inert in simulated mode, so the default deployment's behaviour and byte output are unchanged.
