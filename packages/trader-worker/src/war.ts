// Pure decision engine for murmur's on-chain house WAR + TAXATION layer (see contracts/WarCoffer.sol
// and state.ts driveWar). Extracted into its own module — with NO Durable Object, chain, viem-wallet or
// fly-brain imports — so every rule that decides where REAL USDC moves can be unit-tested in isolation.
//
// THE WAR MODEL (mirrors the arena's resolver discipline, but the outcome is fully PUBLIC). Wars are
// discrete bouts between two feuding HOUSES, cadenced by unix time buckets exactly like arena rounds:
// warId = floor(now / warCadenceSec). Each cron tick, the Worker (as the coffer's authorized resolver) does
// at most a few best-effort writes — top up a vault, declare the feud that is due, resolve the bucket that
// just closed, and post the extra on-chain tax — but WHICH war to declare/resolve is a PURE function of
// (now, cadence, cursor) computed here, so the real-gas decision is testable without a live chain.
//
// WHY NO SEED ORACLE (the deliberate difference from the arena): the coffer derives the winner from the
// inputs COMMITTED AT DECLARE — (warId, attacker, defender, powerA, powerB) — through a public keccak draw,
// so the resolver supplies NOTHING at resolve time and cannot steer a result. The instant a war is declared
// its outcome is fixed and recomputable by anyone. `winnerOf` below is kept BYTE-FOR-BYTE in lock-step with
// WarCoffer._deriveWinner / previewWinner: same field order, same keccak, same modulo. If they ever diverge,
// the on-chain payout and the Worker's mirror disagree — so a unit test pins this against the contract rule.
