// ============================================================================================================
// chronicler.ts — the deterministic historian that turns raw swarm state into STORY and HISTORY.
//
// This is the "chronicle engine": once per cron it reads the SAME read-out the economy reads (collective mood,
// the ethogram FAP distribution, per-fly valence, and the lifetime economy totals) and DETECTS history-making
// moments via pure, stateless-friendly rules — eras dawning, the first settlement, a wealth record, a panic,
// the great huddle, a feeding frenzy, births, milestones, a change of leadership. Each detected event is
// rendered into one narrative sentence FROM A PUBLIC TEMPLATE (no LLM anywhere — the whole project's identity),
// and appended to an ordered, HASH-CHRONED chronicle.
//
// WHY THIS IS PROVABLY "NOT AN LLM" (the verification model, mirrored byte-for-byte in the browser):
//   1. DETERMINISTIC RE-DERIVATION. Every sentence is renderTemplate(kind, tokens) — a pure string substitution
//      over the entry's own `tokens` (the raw numbers it cites). A visitor ships the SAME TEMPLATES table, fills
//      it with the entry's tokens, and must reproduce the served `text` exactly. An LLM cannot be re-derived
//      this way; if the words regenerate from a template + real numbers, they are the template's, not a model's.
//   2. TAMPER-EVIDENT CHAIN. Each entry carries prevHash + hash = sha256(canonical(entryCore) ‖ prevHash). Edit
//      any word and the chain breaks; the head is a single binding digest of the whole history.
//   3. RULES FINGERPRINT. chroniclerRulesHash() = sha256 of the entire deterministic rule-set (templates,
//      thresholds, cooldowns, era-names). It is the historian's "genome": match it and you know exactly WHICH
//      rule-set wrote every line — and that it contains no model, only string templates and comparisons.
//
// Iron-clad constraints this file upholds:
//   • PURE READ-OUT. It observes state; it never mutates a connectome, a drive, a wallet or a settlement
//     decision. Economy remains a one-way read of neurons; nothing here feeds back. Zero gas, zero on-chain
//     commitment, so the brain manifest hash is untouched.
//   • DETERMINISTIC & REPLAYABLE. No Math.random, no Date.now inside the logic (timestamps are passed in),
//     no locale-dependent formatting. Given the same sequence of contexts it yields the same entries + chain.
//   • BOUNDED. It keeps only a handful of monotonic trackers + one running head hash, so its serialized state
//     is tiny and DO-safe.
// ============================================================================================================
