// The murmur public API — an OpenAPI 3.1 contract for the free, read-only endpoints the Worker already
// serves at this deployment's own origin. This object is the single source of truth: it is served verbatim at
// GET /openapi.json (see index.ts) and rendered by the frontend /developers page, so the docs can never
// drift from a hand-maintained copy.
//
// Design notes:
//  • Every path here is FREE, needs no auth/API key, and is CORS-enabled (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *).
//  • Amounts come in two flavours: `*Atomic` / `amount` / `balance` are exact integer strings in the asset's
//    base unit (USDC has 6 decimals); `*Usdc` are convenience floats. Prefer the atomic strings for maths.
//  • The one PAID endpoint (GET /signal/pulse) is an x402 paywall: it answers 402 with machine-readable
//    payment requirements, and only returns the signal once the caller attaches a valid X-PAYMENT. It is
//    documented here for completeness but is not part of the free surface.
//  • Unstable / debug endpoints (POST /tick, POST /reset — ADMIN_TOKEN gated) are intentionally NOT listed.
