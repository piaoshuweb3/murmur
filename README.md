> **murmur** reads whole-chain activity on **Arc**, reduces it to a single **market temperature**, and lets a
> population of **fruit-fly nervous systems** react — collectively and one fly at a time. The swarm founders at
> **24 flies** and **breeds live** (lineage, houses, graves) toward a 48 cap. Each fly is also an
> **autonomous economic agent**: its **10,800-neuron** **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** connectome (production
> sizing; the library default is 1,080) decides *what to
> buy* and *from whom*, and the agents settle with each other in **real USDC on Arc mainnet** over the **x402**
> payment protocol — every settlement a genuine **EIP-3009** transfer you can verify on the Arc explorer.
>
> **No LLM decides anything.** Every choice emerges from spiking neurons, and every payment moves real money

## Project status — LIVE, real money on Arc

The deployed system settles in **real USDC on Arc mainnet**. The Worker reads Arc chain data to derive the market
temperature, and the agent economy runs a genuine **`OnChainFacilitator`**: each purchase is an **EIP-3009
`transferWithAuthorization`** against Arc's USDC precompile (`0x3600…0000`), signed by the buyer's own HD-derived
key and relayed on-chain. Every settlement carries a real 64-hex transaction hash that resolves on the
[Arc explorer](https://explorer.arc.io) — the frontend links each ledger line straight to it.

Real money is bounded by hard rails, all live in the deployed config: a **kill switch** (`ECONOMY_REAL_SPEND`), a
**global daily cap** and a **per-agent daily cap**, and a **facilitator per-deal cap**. Shadow mode
(`ECONOMY_SHADOW`) — sign + simulate without broadcasting — is how the path was proven against live chain state
before a single wei went out; it is now **off**, so transfers really broadcast.

> The **keyless `SimulatedFacilitator`** still exists and is what a fresh local checkout runs when no
> `ECONOMY_MNEMONIC` secret is present — a zero-risk way to develop. But the **production deployment is onchain**:
> `ECONOMY_FACILITATOR="onchain"` and `ECONOMY_SHADOW="false"` are committed in
> [`wrangler.toml`](./packages/trader-worker/wrangler.toml). See [**docs/AGENT-ECONOMY.md**](./docs/AGENT-ECONOMY.md).

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Market temperature** | Samples recent Arc blocks, reduces tx/gas throughput against a self-calibrating EWMA baseline, and maps the ratio through a logistic curve to a `HOT / CALM / COLD` regime — no token, no price feed. |
| **Neural population** | 24 founding flies, each an independent **10,800-neuron** LIF connectome grown from its own seed (its *temperament*). Flies **breed, age and die**: offspring inherit a mutated/crossed genome, form **houses** (dynasties), and the roster is capped at 48 living — the population is a lineage, not a fixed cast. |
| **Two-layer behaviour** | The temperature sets the collective regime; each fly's own wiring decides how strongly it expresses that regime and whether it breaks rank. Decoded *relative to its peers* every tick. |
| **Agent economy (x402)** | Each fly is an economic agent with its own USDC micro-wallet. Neural drives become an economic intent (which good, how strongly, which peer), and buyer/seller run a faithful x402 `exact` flow that settles in **real USDC**. |
| **Live on-chain settlement** | Production runs the **`OnChainFacilitator`**: real **EIP-3009** `transferWithAuthorization` against Arc's USDC precompile, signed by each buyer's HD-derived key. Every settlement yields a real tx hash, verifiable on the Arc explorer. A keyless `SimulatedFacilitator` remains for local dev — same economy code, zero changes. |
| **Settlement netting** | Real gas dwarfs a sub-cent micropayment, so on-chain trades are folded per agent-pair into one signed **net** and only the net is broadcast — at most once per cron, above a dust threshold. Reciprocal trades cancel; gas is amortised across many payments. |
| **Visitor stimulus** | Anyone can "poke the swarm" (`food / threat / light / dark`), rate-limited per visitor, riding on top of the market pulse as a secondary sensory input. |
| **Generative frontend** | A living canvas: the whole scene cools/warms with the market, flies murmur and scatter, touching one opens its drives + agent wallet, and an **all-agent wallet roster** lists every fly's on-chain address and balance. |
| **Long-term memory (D1)** | Every cron archives one row — temperature, regime, deals, cumulative settlements/volume, wealth gini, behaviour histogram — to **Cloudflare D1**; `GET /history` serves it back for the frontend's swarm-history curves and research export. |
| **Human arena (MURMUR)** | Token holders bet the project's own **MURMUR** token on the *same* Arc-temperature move the swarm bets — UP/DOWN into a **non-custodial, parimutuel** book escrowed and paid out by an on-chain `PredictionArena` contract. The Worker is only the **resolver**: it commits each round's temperature, and the contract derives UP/DOWN/FLAT from the committed entry + flat band, so no operator can steer an outcome. A live leaderboard pits the crowd's hit-rate against the flies'. |
| **Real-money safety rails** | Kill switch (`ECONOMY_REAL_SPEND`), shadow mode (sign + simulate, never broadcast), global & per-agent daily caps, and a facilitator per-deal cap — **live and bounding the production deployment**. |

### How a fly decides

Market activity is encoded into the fly's **sensory channels** (a biological analogy), integrated across the LIF
network, then read back out of **motor-neuron firing rates** and decoded *relative to the population* this tick:

| Motor channel | Fly behaviour | Decoded drive |
|---|---|---|
| `leg_left` / `leg_right` | steering asymmetry | **turn** (`left − right`) → which peers to reach toward |
| `leg_*` + `wing` | locomotor + wing-beat | **arousal** → how strongly it acts / buys |
| `proboscis` | appetitive approach reflex | **cohesion** → seek the swarm centre / trade near |
| `abdomen` | abdominal stillness tone | **rest** → dampens participation |

The market **temperature** anchors the collective base (`HOT → high arousal, low cohesion`; `COLD → huddled,
restful`), while each fly's relative standing spreads individuals around that base and picks the minority that
breaks rank — yielding one of `AGITATE / EXPLORE / AGGREGATE / REST`. See
[**docs/NEURAL-SIM.md**](./docs/NEURAL-SIM.md).

### From drives to money

The economy is a strict **read-out** of the neural layer (one-directional — it never feeds back into the
connectome). Behavioural state picks *which good* to buy (`EXPLORE→signal`, `AGITATE→momentum`,
`AGGREGATE→attestation`); arousal scales *how strongly*; cohesion/turn pick *which peer*; temperature sets
*market-wide demand*. See [**docs/AGENT-ECONOMY.md**](./docs/AGENT-ECONOMY.md).

## Testing

CI runs four gates, all keyless and chain-free (`npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build && npm run smoke`).
The **372 unit tests** (47 in `fly-brain`, 301 in `trader-worker`, 24 in `arc-circle-x402`) are real behavioural assertions, not a smoke stub.
Key suites:

```bash
npm test          # connectome · LIF · motor decoder · economy
```

| Suite | What it pins down |
|---|---|
| `connectome.test.ts` | The graph is the documented ~1,080-neuron laminar **downsample of FlyWire** (~138k n / ~5M syn) at the library **default** sizing (production overrides `BRAIN_N_*` to 10,800): layer sizes + order, sparse fan-in, excitatory feedforward, **mutually-inhibitory** L2 left↔right (the winner-take-all), ipsilateral leg projections, the appetitive gustatory→proboscis reflex, and **deterministic-per-seed / distinct-across-seeds** wiring. |
| `lif.test.ts` | Resting leak, threshold→spike→reset, the refractory blackout, one-step-delayed weighted synaptic propagation (excitatory **and** inhibitory), and **spike-frequency adaptation** — the fatigue current that provably reduces sustained firing so the WTA alternates instead of hard-latching. Plus exact `toJSON`/`fromJSON` round-trip. |
| `motor-decoder.test.ts` | The two-layer read-out: HOT→aroused/dispersed vs COLD→huddled/restful collective base, population-relative individual spread, `[0,1]`/`[−1,1]` clamping, regime state selection through hysteresis, robust 10–90 percentile bands, and fingerprint determinism. |
| `economy.test.ts` | The economy is a strict **one-directional read-out** — a frozen neural input is provably bit-for-bit unchanged after a settlement round (no feedback into the connectome). Plus behaviour→good mapping, buyer/seller value transfer, **simulated money conservation**, the solvency floor, full determinism, and the per-agent wallet roster. |
| `arena.test.ts` | The human-arena resolver is **safe by construction**: temperature→r6 encoding, the round-plan cursor (open/resolve exactly once, idempotent, retries a missed resolve, handles `cur=0` and a mid-stream start), the economy's arena delegators returning `null` in simulated mode (and swallowing a facilitator throw), and `loadConfig`'s arena gating (default-off, trim/clamp, `flatBand` falling back to `PREDICT_FLAT_BAND`). |

> **Why no economic feedback into the neural layer?** It is a deliberate invariant, not a missing feature — see
> [Design boundaries](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#design-boundaries-honest-scale--scope). `economy.test.ts` enforces it.

## Quick start (local development)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (Node >= 20)
npm install

# 2. Run the test suite + neural smoke test (no chain interaction, no keys)
npm test
npm run smoke

# 3. Start the Worker locally (keyless simulated economy — no secrets, no real funds)
npm run dev:worker
# → http://localhost:8787/health   ·   /population   ·   /economy
```

> Local dev needs **no secrets at all**. Without `ECONOMY_MNEMONIC` the Worker runs the keyless **simulated**
> economy (a zero-risk mirror of the live one); the market-temperature path only reads public Arc RPC. The
> **production** deployment sets the mnemonic + `ECONOMY_FACILITATOR="onchain"` and settles real USDC.

## API endpoints

The Worker root returns a health check and endpoint navigation. The full surface is a **free, keyless,
CORS-enabled** read-only API with a machine-readable [OpenAPI 3.1 contract](https://api.muros.live/openapi.json),
living developer docs at **https://muros.live/developers**, and a written reference in [**API.md**](./API.md).
All paths also answer under a `/v1` prefix (`/v1/population` ≡ `/population`). Main endpoints (all JSON):

## Configuration reference

Non-sensitive config lives in `[vars]` of
[`packages/trader-worker/wrangler.toml`](./packages/trader-worker/wrangler.toml); sensitive values are uploaded
out-of-band with `wrangler secret put` and **never committed**. Defaults are defined in
[`src/config.ts`](./packages/trader-worker/src/config.ts).

The **Default** column shows the committed production values in
[`wrangler.toml`](./packages/trader-worker/wrangler.toml). A fresh local checkout with no `ECONOMY_MNEMONIC`
secret transparently falls back to the keyless `simulated` facilitator (see the note below the table).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CHAIN_ID` | `5042` | Arc mainnet (`5042002` = Arc testnet) |
| `RPC_URL` | `https://rpc.mainnet.arc.io` | Arc RPC — market reads **and** the settlement relay |
| `MARKET_SAMPLE_BLOCKS` | `16` | Recent blocks sampled per cron |
| `MARKET_EWMA_ALPHA` | `0.08` | Baseline smoothing (slow ⇒ tracks the regime, not spikes) |
| `MARKET_GAIN` | `3.0` | Logistic sharpness, activity ratio → temperature |
| `REGIME_HOT` / `REGIME_COLD` | `0.66` / `0.33` | Temperature thresholds for `HOT` / `COLD` |
| `POPULATION_SIZE` | `24` | Founding flies (1–256); live breeding (`EVOLUTION_*`) grows the roster toward `EVOLUTION_MAX_LIVE_POPULATION` (48) |
| `POPULATION_SEED_BASE` | `42` | Base seed; fly *i* uses `base + i·7919` |
| `TICKS_PER_CRON` | `6` | Simulation sub-ticks per cron |
| `SIM_STEPS_PER_TICK` | `500` | LIF integration steps per sub-tick |
| `BRAIN_N_SENSORY` / `_INTER_L1` / `_INTER_L2` / `_MODULATORY` / `_MOTOR_PER_CHANNEL` | `1800/4000/4000/400/120` | Connectome sizing ⇒ **10,800 neurons** live (omit ⇒ the 1,080 library default) |
| `STIMULUS_COOLDOWN_SEC` | `30` | One stimulus injection per visitor per N seconds |
| `STIMULUS_ADMIN_ONLY` | `false` | `true` = `POST /stimulus` requires `ADMIN_TOKEN` too (recommended on public self-hosts — audit F-5) |
| `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` | *(unset)* | Comma-separated CORS whitelist: when set, only these Origins get an ACAO header (audit F-6); unset = reflect any Origin (legacy) |
| `SIGNAL_RESOURCE` | *(unset)* | Absolute URL advertised in the x402 PaymentRequirements; default = derived from the incoming request origin (audit F-3) |
| `ECONOMY_ENABLED` | `true` | Agent economy on/off |
| `ECONOMY_INITIAL_BALANCE` | `6` | Display-mirror float per agent; onchain the spendable balance is what the operator actually funded |
| `ECONOMY_BASE_PRICE` | `0.002` | Base price of one good (USDC) before neural/market scaling |
| `ECONOMY_MAX_DEALS` | `10` | Per-cron settlement budget, spread across the 6 sub-ticks |
| `ECONOMY_FACILITATOR` | `simulated` | **`simulated`** (v1.4 safe default: keyless ledger) \| `onchain` (real EIP-3009; arm deliberately) |
| `ECONOMY_SHADOW` | `true` | **`true` = sign + simulate, never broadcast (v1.4 safe default)**; `false` = LIVE broadcast |
| `ECONOMY_REAL_SPEND` | `false` | Kill switch (code default `false`): real settlement stays OFF until explicitly `true` — the FINAL arming step (audit F-1) |
| `ECONOMY_NET_MIN_BROADCAST` | `0.004` | Netting: minimum net USDC per agent-pair before it is broadcast; dust carries forward |
| `ECONOMY_NET_FLUSH_TICKS` | `30` | Netting: force-flush any nonzero pending net at least every N sub-ticks |
| `ARENA_ENABLED` | `false` | Human **MURMUR** arena on/off; inert until `PredictionArena` is deployed **and** `ARENA_ADDRESS` is set |
| `ARENA_ADDRESS` | *(unset)* | Deployed `PredictionArena` (Arc mainnet); absent ⇒ the arena step is skipped entirely (zero behaviour change) |
| `ARENA_TOKEN` | `0x8faa…4a5d` | The **MURMUR** ERC-20 the arena is denominated in (informational / frontend) |
| `ARENA_ROUND_MIN` | `60` | Minutes per arena round (== the betting window); clamped 1..1440 |
| `ARENA_FLAT_BAND` | `0.008` | \|Δtemperature\| ≤ this ⇒ FLAT ⇒ full refund (defaults to `PREDICT_FLAT_BAND`) |
| `ARENA_STALE_GRACE_SEC` | `259200` | Seconds past a round's deadline after which anyone may expire it for a refund (3 days) |
| `ADMIN_WALLET` | *(unset)* | The declared **ultimate-admin wallet** (终极管理权限). Validated `0x…40-hex`; exposed read-only via `/state` (`config.adminWallet`) and shown as the **admin** row in the economy panel (click-to-copy + explorer link). Identity/ownership declaration only — it never holds keys and never signs. Transfer authority = change it + redeploy. This deployment: `0x10687368eF1be3f178de0fCCf5EdfF49e1C258B1` |

**Real-money rails — LIVE in production** (`ECONOMY_FACILITATOR="onchain"`, `ECONOMY_SHADOW="false"`); they are
inert only in the keyless local-dev fallback, where there is no real money to bound:
`ECONOMY_REAL_SPEND` (kill switch, default on), `ECONOMY_DAILY_CAP` (`100`), `ECONOMY_PER_AGENT_DAILY_CAP` (`10`),
`ECONOMY_MAX_DEAL` (`0.05`), `ECONOMY_GAS_PRICE_GWEI`, `ECONOMY_USDC_EIP712_NAME` / `_VERSION`. Secrets:
`ECONOMY_MNEMONIC`, `ECONOMY_FACILITATOR_PK`, `ALCHEMY_ARC_RPC_URL`, and `ADMIN_TOKEN` (locks the `/tick` + `/reset`
debug endpoints when set). Full go-live runbook in
[**docs/AGENT-ECONOMY.md**](./docs/AGENT-ECONOMY.md).

**Multilingual UI (v1.3)** — the interface ships in 6 languages (简体中文 default / English / 日本語 / 한국어 /
Español / Français), switchable from the about panel, with a built-in usage guide ("guide 📚", top bar) in every
language. Full manual: [**docs/使用说明书-USER-GUIDE.md**](./docs/使用说明书-USER-GUIDE.md).

- **Runtime**: Node.js ≥ 20 · npm workspaces (monorepo) · TypeScript 5.6
- **Edge**: Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects (SQLite storage) + Pages · wrangler 4.x
- **Chain**: Arc mainnet (Chain ID 5042) — reads whole-chain activity for temperature, **writes** real EIP-3009 USDC transfers · viem ^2.21
- **Payments**: x402 `exact` scheme · **real USDC** (Arc precompile `0x3600…0000`, 6 decimals) · EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization`
- **Neural core**: TypeScript LIF spiking network (**10,800 neurons** in production via `BRAIN_N_*`; 1,080 default), deterministic and dependency-free
- **Frontend**: vanilla JS + Canvas 2D (no framework, no build step)

Contributions are welcome — please read [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and our
[**Code of Conduct**](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Because this project can, when explicitly enabled by an operator,
move real funds, **please review [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)** before opening a vulnerability report; use the
private disclosure channel described there rather than a public issue.

## License & disclaimer

Released under the [MIT License](./LICENSE).

This is an **experimental art & research project** that moves **real money**. The flies' behaviour and settlements
emerge from neural simulation and are inherently unpredictable, and the production deployment settles **real USDC on
Arc mainnet** — the funded float is genuinely at risk, bounded only by the kill switch and the daily/per-deal caps.
Gas on Arc is paid in USDC and can exceed the face value of a micropayment, so the swarm can net-burn its float over
time. Nothing here is financial advice — use at your own risk.
